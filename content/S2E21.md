In our 21st Zoomcast (September 3, 2020) Charlotte Ferrell hosts a discussion focussing on Labour Day.

We open with a TED Talk on the meaning of Labour Day for Americans and Canadians. The follow-up discussion addresses various topics including labour history, exploitation, the rights of aging workers, the role of unions, the gig economy, teleworking, seniors engaging in labor advocacy, and the future of the workforce.

In the final segment. Pat Hogan reads her story Serendipitous Downtown Eastside Christmasses and Chris Morrissey reads a short story which shows how immigrant counselling changes a life lived in the shadows.

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
