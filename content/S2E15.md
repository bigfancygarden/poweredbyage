Our 15th Zoomcast (July 23, 2020) features two guests and a poetry reading.

We open with a video demonstrating seated exercises for aching backs and backsides from the series Senior Fitness with Meredith.

Our first guest, filmmaker Adel Arop, talks about how to create the most effective mindset for the journey towards wellness.

Our second guest, Judith Rainey, shares her personal experience with the 811 Health Line.

Finally, Sista C shares her personal healing journey and reads inspiring poetry from her book From Pillows to Pillars.

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver
