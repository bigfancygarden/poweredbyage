Our 13th Zoomcast (July 23, 2020) features three guests interested in food and nutrition.

Our first guest, City Councillor Sarah Kirby-Young, talks about food friendly neighbourhoods and the demise of the corner grocery store.

In our second segment, Anthony Kupferschmidt, Executive Director of the West End Seniors Network, discusses food insecurity among seniors.

Finally, Emily Hsu shares some advice from her book Mindful Eating for Vibrant Living.

A warm thank-you to Sylvia Anderson for putting this show together, and to Neall Ryon for reading his poem Who Killed Mom and Pop?

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
