Our 86th Zoomcast (December 30, 2021);

We introduce ourselves by sharing good things we will take with us into the new year.

Joel Flynn introduces Chris Schultz from Horizon School of Music who talks about the school’s programmes for adults and at-risk youth. Inspired by the recently released Beatles documentary, Joel sings Let it Be, Here Comes the Sun, and Hey Jude.

Neall reads his joyful tribute to his brother, A White Ford Pickup with Texas Plates, Jeannie Kamins reads her poem One Kick at the Can, and Charlotte Ferrell reads her Kwanzaa poem Stepping Through Kwanzaa.

We share our intentions for the New Year. Dr. Ramona Srinivasan shares her intention to follow the mantra 'Lokah samasta sukino bhavantu' (May all living beings everywhere be happy and free).

Our host #CharlotteSistaCFerrell invites listeners to hear all the issues we covered in 2021 by listening to podcast recordings on YouTube, Spotify, iTunes or our website, poweredbyage.com.

Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society; The Government of Canada: New Horizons Grant; and G & F Financial.
