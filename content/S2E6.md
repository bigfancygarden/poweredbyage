Our 6th Zoomcast (May 21, 2020) features a special guest from COSCO BC.

Today we welcome Linda Forsythe from COSCO BC (Council of Senior Citizens Organizations of B.C.) to introduce her organization and discuss some of the work they are doing. Topics covered in our discussion include:

Issues with for-profit long-term care facilities and the case for de-privatization

The need for a national pharmacare programme.

Continuity of care (care homes versus aging in place).

Our concluding creative segment features Neill Ryon and Lesley Hebert reading from their prose/poetry collaboration “A Million Million Stars.”

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
