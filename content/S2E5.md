In our 5th Zoomcast (May 14, 2020) two guests discuss two very different topics.

In our first segment, Pat Hogan welcomes special guest Veronica Grassey, Program Manager at Volunteer Grandparents information. Veronica provides information on how her organization helps to meet community needs for supportive and nurturing connection.

In our second segment, 411 Board Chair Marion Pollack talks about the impact of COVID-19 on 411 income tax clinics. We discuss the importance of technology during COVID-19 for both community connection and health care, and how the pandemic has created awareness of the “digital divide” among seniors.

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
