This is my first "blog post" into the Big Fancy Garden. After a bit of research, I decided to register the domain www.bigfancygarden.com using Cloudflare (instead of GoDaddy or Namecheap). Their prices seem reasonable, and frankly, I've had only so-so experiences with GoDaddy.

I also decided on using Quartz at this time. As I'm just getting started with publishing a Digital Garden, I didn't want to get bogged down with tech setup and futzing. I can always move it over later on if I feel the need.

Sadly, I've run into an immediate problem. I use the Dataview community plugin to create MOCs (Maps of Content), but unfortunately Obsidian Publish doesn't support plugins.

I have found a solution, [[Obsidian Publish with Dataview]], but it is a bit complicated for me to try to implement right this moment.

I'm already starting to find problems, or rather, limitations with Obsidian Publish's presentation and navigation. I might have to accelerate a transition to Quartz.

Thanks
