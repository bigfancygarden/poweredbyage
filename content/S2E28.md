In our 28th Zoomcast (October 22, 2020) we look at how far our podcast has come.

Charlotte Ferrell opens by acknowledging how the Powered by Age podcasts emerged from four multi-topic, studio-recorded episodes last year, to creating 28 (to date) episodes of non-scripted discussions on topics or issues suggested by participants.  She confirmed ways participants have become  Powered by Age Ambassadors who have learned how to access digital platforms, help others get connected, and  collaborate in making special presentations. She welcomes participants to celebrate our seventh month of podcasting and to continue pursuing the goal of making Vancouver an age-friendly city.

Participants Neall Ryon, Don Martin, Chris Morrissey and Lesley Hebert discuss ways they have  enjoyed the  benefits of collaboration,  discovered inspiration and creativity, and reflected upon love and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic..We finish with a discussion of possible future collaborations and creative endeavours.

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
