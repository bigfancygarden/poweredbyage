Our 7th Zoomcast (May 28, 2020) features an insightful discussion with a special guest.

We open with participants sharing their positive lockdown experiences.

Next we welcome special guest Ishmael Traore, Engagement Advisor, from The UBC Centre for Community Engaged Learning. Ishmael leads a discussion focussing on two questions from the City of Vancouver Planning Department:

What would a thriving relationship between nature and urban life look like in Vancouver?

What would a city that truly adopts reconciliation and decolonization look like?

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
