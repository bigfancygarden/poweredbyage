Our 34th Zoomcast (December 3, 2020).

Charlotte welcomes Samela Dingus and Elizabeth Wu, seniors active in The Agape Wise Ones, a spirituality group that helps elders develop their unique talents.

Robin Erickson facilitates a discussion on the meaning of loss using Angel cards. Participants’ personal responses to randomly selected cards (gratitude, patience, flexibility, respect, power, communication, responsibility, presence, trust and strength) lead into an engaging, reflective discussion.

Neall Ryon reads Round and Round, a poem he wrote for his deceased brother Don.

Charlotte announces upcoming special programs including Zoom meetings on Christmas and New Years’ Eve.

Hosted by Charlotte 'Sista C' Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver
