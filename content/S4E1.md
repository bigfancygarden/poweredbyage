Our host CharlotteSistaCFerrell announces that PBA will be celebrating National Poetry Month throughout April and expressing its theme “Speaking of Intimacy,“  and invites us to share images and thoughts about partner, personal, family, community and spiritual intimacy.

We discuss the importance of trust for emotional and physical intimacy.

We discuss poetry as an act of intimacy with ourselves and Lesley reads A Jug of Wine, A Loaf of Bread and Thou from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Neall closes with Rumi’s poem True Love.
