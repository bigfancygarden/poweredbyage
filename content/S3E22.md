Our 72nd Zoomcast (September 16, 2021);

Our podcasters write and read inspiring stories based on Charlotte’s prompt:

"a 7.5-year-old child and their 75-year-old relative are planning to make a lunch to take outside. Write how you think their conversation will go.”

Stories included “A picnic with Nana”, and A first day of Preschool.

Charlotte presents ideas for using paper plates and found materials to create crests representing us as individuals, our backgrounds, and our state of mind. We describe our creations to the group and discuss the history and meaning of crests in various cultures. Neall Ryon reads a new poem, the Yellow Umbrella.

Music: "Allegro Autunnale" by Dee Yan-Key
