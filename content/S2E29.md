Our 29th Zoomcast (October 29, 2020) features a free ranging discussion on social roles.

Facilitator, Robin Erickson invites participants to consider the various roles they play or have played in the past. Our discussion touches on the freedom of chosen roles versus the strictures of assigned roles, and the influence of family and upbringing. Everyone wore a hat to the virtual meeting and emphatically comments on how hats evolve throughout our lives and change to meet the needs of the moment. People share examples of how different roles we play influence the formation of our authentic self.

Neall Ryon reads his new poem, Masks.

Hosted by Charlotte 'Sista C' Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
