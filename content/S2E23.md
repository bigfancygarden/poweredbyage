Our 23rd Zoomcast (September 17, 2020) features a discussion of creativity and health. Charlotte Ferrell describes the physical benefits of creativity. These include remission of dementia and improved cognition, problem solving and mental health. Adel Arop talks about creativity, her personal healing journey, and engages the group in some poetry games that stimulate the memory.

Charlotte Ferrell presents Twelve Habits of Creative People and participants give examples of using them.

Our conversation included: physical responses to the creative process, brainwaves as vibrations, the importance of play and curiosity, creative problem solving, ways to overcome your inner critic and find your authentic voice, and how to overcome recurring negative patterns.

Hosted by Charlotte “Sista C” Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
