Our 39th Zoomcast (January 7th, 2021);

On the first Thursday of 2021, Charlotte encourages us to talk about democracy and resilience.

In light of the storming of the U.S. Capitol, we discuss the definition of democracy and problems inherent within it. We consider the role of poets and other creative writers in supporting and promoting social justice. We talk about our ability to have a positive influence in social media by building resilience, hope and transformation. We explore the resilience seniors have built through life experiences.

Hosted by Charlotte Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
