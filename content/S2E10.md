Our 10th Zoomcast (June 18, 2020) celebrates Juneteenth and features a special interview.

Charlotte Ferrell reads a statement on racism from 411 Seniors Centre. She points to Canadian connections with Juneteenth and highlights ongoing international concerns about human trafficking.

Sylvie Anderson interviews Christine Telford of the UK about her ground-breaking career as a female geologist in the oil and gas industry.

Pat Hogan of QUIRKY presents a virtually produced video for the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia.

We finish with two poetry readings, Neill Ryon reads Erasure and Sista C reads a Fathersâ€™ Day poem for Juneteenth.
