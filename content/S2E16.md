For our 16th Zoomcast (July 30, 2020), we welcomed 3 special guests to the show.

In the first segment, Don Davies (Member of Parliament for Vancouver-Kingsway) discusses some of the key issues facing seniors and ways in which the federal government could address them.

In the second segment, writer and teacher Ruth Kozak talks about her experiences as a self-employed 86-year-old living in Vancouver.

In the third segment, BC Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie talks about seniors in the workplace, ageist attitudes in society, and more.

Special thanks to Gail Harwood and Lesley Hebert for all their hard work as coordinators and interviewers for this week's episode.

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
