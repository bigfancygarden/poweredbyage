Charlotte announces our celebration of Black History month and introduces Dr. Charles Quist-Adade, facilitator for today’s program. He outlines the programme of 25 Years of Black History Month: Celebration and Reflection, a February 28 event, that will explore common threads among the customs and values of different African countries and people of African descent. We hear members of the organizations that collaborated to produce the “25 Years” event.

Dr. Quist-Adade sang an African song and told the story of why Anansi the Spider has no head. Teacher and storyteller Mme. Comfort Ero told the story of how Anansi broke a gourd full of wisdom and it was spilled out into the world. Queen Kombe told us about a wise woman who saved her family from being eaten by monsters. They expressed that variations of these stories are told in different African countries and the West Indies.

We discuss how storytellers can adapt stories for children; other popular characters in African folk tales; and cultural appropriation. Here is how to get in touch with today’s participants:
