Our 49th Zoomcast (March 18th, 2021);

Charlotte acknowledged we are still celebrating Women’s History Month and we will have special stories today related to the international theme, “Choose to Challenge.”

Joel Flynn announced the St. Patrick’s Day release of an album by his father Doug Flynn which is available for no charge at https://soundcloud.com/podstream/sets/doug-flynns-desolation-sounds-vol-1. Joel assures us he will be sharing some of his personal music next week.

Nansey Sinclaire told a personal story about improving her physical and mental health through observing her eating prompts and habits during a 30-day nutrition challenge. She describes how learning to read labels helped her eliminate and find substitutes for dairy, wheat, and sugar.

Chris Morrissey read “Walking in History,” which memorializes the day she and her partner were officially recognized for their successful fight to obtain immigration rights for same sex and common law couples.

Charlotte Ferrell highlighted plans for PBAs 50th episode celebration and asked everyone to invite friends to subscribe to https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVNU4fOZZQ7DgLufr1ReLmQ so they can interact with our live broadcast on YouTube next week or post comments on our podcast audios anytime.
