Our 82nd Zoomcast (November 25, 2021);

We introduce ourselves with a “word of the day” and our host Charlotte Ferrell invites us to present pictures which are “worth 1000 words.” Neall Ryon shows us a photo of him chatting with a panda in China. Ramona Srinivasen describes an 80-year-old family photo. She tells us about the people in the picture, and we discuss connections between pictures and memories. Charlotte shows us a picture of a robot camera, and talks about its potential use in future programming.

Neall Ryon reads his poem How Dare You Write Poetry! In our feedback on his reading, we consider boundaries as both limitations and challenges.

Charlotte provides information on the online writers’ resource kindlepreneur.com and shows us one of its free writers, tools, lists of trigger words for emotions such as energy, fear and trust.

Ramona Srinivasan tells us about her upcoming workshop on “The Brain”

Charlotte encourages us to pass along information on our podcast and to send contact information for potential new members to pbaafc@gmail.com

Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society; The Government of Canada: New Horizons Grant; and G & F Financial.
