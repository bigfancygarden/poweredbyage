Our 3rd Zoomcast (April 30, 2020) features brainstorming, open discussion and an invitation to the poetic muse.

Neall Ryon reads his poem A Birthright.

Charlotte Ferrell encourages participants to brainstorm content for future programmes and Sylvie Anderson provides a preview of an upcoming session.

Adel Arop encourages participants to work together to create a poem. The result is a cooperative poetic musing on the topic of social isolation, and a discussion of ways to overcome it.

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
