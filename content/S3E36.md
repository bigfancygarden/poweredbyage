Our host #CharlotteSistaCFerrell welcomes everyone to our Holiday Cheer podcast and Nansey Sinclair and her daughter Christine share a fun Christmas trivia game.

Joel Flynn sings a selection of holiday songs: Dean Martin’s Marshmallow World, It’s Beginning to Look Like Christmas, Silver Bells and Let it Snow.

Neall Ryon reads his poems: Siddhartha by the River and In the Stillness.

Ramona, Leslie and others comment on ways the poems generate positive emotions and self-reflection.

In recognition of Kwanzaa, December 26-Jan 1, #CharlotteSistaCFerrell reads a segment of the Annual Message by #KwanzaaFather, Dr. Maulana Karenga, “bringing greetings of celebration, solidarity and continuing struggle for good in the world.”

Elizabeth Wu reads To Ann, a poem dedicated to a friend in hospice.
