Our 107th Zoomcast (May 19, 2022);

Our host #CharlotteSistaCFerrell introduces Greta de Leon, Executive Director of the American Research Network and co-curator of the new feature exhibition Xicanex at the UBC Museum of Anthropology. Speaking to us from Morelos, Mexico, Greta discusses the importance of this diverse exhibition of Chicano art, poetry and stories by self-identified Chicano artists, and its relationship to migrant workers and indigenous people in B.C. She reads a poem from the exhibition, H is a Word my Tongue Cannot Speak by Anjelica Maria Aguilera, and answers our questions about the show.
