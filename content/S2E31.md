Our 31st Zoomcast (November 12, 2020) is all about war and peace.

Host Robin Erickson reminds us that todayâ€™s discussion takes place on the 75 th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, the end of WWII and the founding of the UN.

Panelists share Remembrance Day memories and ways they commemorate November 11th now.

We address the current relevance of Remembrance Day ceremonies, the causes of war, its pointlessness and its financial and human cost. We discuss the glorification of war, the lack of recognition of wartime trauma and uncounted civilian casualties, and whether it is possible to create positive change.

Neill Ryon reads his poem The Forgotten. Lesley Hebert reads Dulce et Decorum Est by Wilfred Owen.

Hosted by Robin Erickson. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
