Our 78th Zoomcast (Thursday, Aug 19);

We learn the Who, Why and What about "Influencers",  and explore whether YOU could be one with our guest, Dr. Ramona Srinivasan.

She has been teaching in schools and colleges, across Mumbai for 40 years. Her students included Bollywood film stars, and the grandson of the then Prime Minister of India, Morarji Desai.

She has written several textbooks in History and workbooks in French. I received a publication award for her published thesis,Diarchy in the Bombay Presidency.

Her other passions include singing, mostly Western music in choirs in India and Canada as well. IShe also sing spiritual songs in Sanskrit, known as bhajans (kirtans), which she continues here on zoom every Sunday, with a group in Lagos , Nigeria.

She has always been a voracious reader, and is ever grateful to the libraries in Canada, which permit me to continue reading one fiction and one nonfiction book every week. In Toronto, she joined the Active Adults Centre, in Mississauga, where she participated in various events, like a fundraiser with the Active Goan Adults, and volunteer work in Telephone Reassurance.
