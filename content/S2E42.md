Our 42nd Zoomcast (January 28th, 2021);

Charlotte Ferrell announces the launch of an “Interview Reservoir   Campaign” to achieve a goal set by PBA podcasters in 2020 to: “create  Canadas’s largest reservoir of interviews about ‘interesting’, ‘notable’  older people. Joel Flynn, one of our technical support gurus, for  participants and listeners, engages us in discussing challenges such as  saving and sharing files to Zoom via Google Drive.

After Chris Morrisey shares part of her thirty-minute interview with  feminist lawyer Barbara Findlay, we talk about using this interview as  the basis for a future webinar, and other programming ideas.

Neall Ryon shares his experience in creating a short interview with his young grandson, Benjamin.

Nansy Sinclaire describes Nancy’s Travel Showcase, a series of  interviews she’s planning with people around Vancouver Island, with the  intent of  building relationships when people are able to travel again.

Hosted by Charlotte Sista C Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society, Vancouver.
