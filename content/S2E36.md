Our 36th Zoomcast (December 17th 2020);

Charlotte introduces today’s podcast theme, “Wishes and More” , thanks the  411 Seniors Centre Society for supporting our podcasts, and acknowledges their delivery of Christmas hampers to shut-in 411 Center members.

Robin Erickson invites us to share two wishes, one for ourselves and one for someone else. Participants exchange their hopes and strengths regarding grace, patience, healing, creative energy, human connection, security, peace and love.

Mariko Makashima, the 411 Seniors Centre Volunteer Coordinator, introduces a drawing for ten prizes to be awarded to lucky 411 Centre members. She recognizes the local vendors from whom all prizes were purchased.  Brian Phillips, an original podcast peer leader and 411 Center volunteer reads his poem about the transformative power of snow.

Hosted by Charlotte Sista C Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver
