Our 62nd Zoomcast (July 8, 2021);

Charlotte welcomed new and existing participants to introduce themselves around something they love to do. We used the Zoom “rooms” and discussed how the interests and skills identified will help us select future topics or activities. Chris informed us that City Council has approved a new LGBTQ2+ Center after 20 years. Nansey is keen on presenting a travelogue of beautiful, nearby affordable places; Diane loves sharing a variety of writing styles and teaching holistic health practices; Neal described new explorations of the emotional world reflected in his poetry and a new book of short stories. Jesse confirmed people will be able to make appointments to record new SPINS for the PBA website. Our next two months will be termed Awesome August, and Savvy September.
