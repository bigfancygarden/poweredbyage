Our 81st Zoomcast (November 18, 2021);

Host, Charlotte Ferrell Introduces special guests Andrew Sixsmith and Hannah Shin of SFU’s STAR Institute who describe the community-based research they are conducting with the 411 Seniors’ Centre on the digital divide and accessible technology. They highlight the value of having a researcher onsite, assisting 411 Center volunteers with the arduous task of helping seniors install the Covid-19 vaccination QR code on their phones, and documenting other priority issues.

We discuss issues around the Provincial government roll out of the Covid-19 vaccination card, and the importance of providing immediate feedback to governmental and business entities that seniors (and others) need alternative-non digital ways of receiving vital information.
