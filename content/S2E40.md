Our 40th Zoomcast (January 14th, 2021);

In celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King’s birthday, Charlotte opens a  discussion on servant leadership and the benevolent community by  sharing thoughts on the civil rights movement and the power of  non-violent protest.

We discuss leadership, public service, the potential for corruption  at the political and the local level, and the capacity of political  activism to forge links between people, groups and causes. We also  recognize the need for positive healing energy, the value of the  imperfect healer and leaders with conviction, the divisive force of  opposing convictions and the challenge of change.

Hosted by Charlotte Sista C Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society.
