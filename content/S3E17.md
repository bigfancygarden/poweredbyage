In the midst of this Heat Wave, we have a cool treat for you.  Join our Podcast ship and enjoy Nansey Sinclaire’s travelogue “Day trip to Nanaimo”. You will almost feel the sea breeze as we travel along the waterfront, roam downtown, and check out the restaurants, museums, and art galleries. Imagine an overnight stay with a little jaunt over to Newcastle, Protection or Gabriola Island from downtown Nanaimo. Get answers to your questions on where, how, or how much it takes to travel to the islands “across the way.” Hear about special ferry fees for seniors on certain days. Nansey is a PBA production team member, former radio show host, innovative 50+ owner of a pet ‘nurturing’ business, and a community services volunteer.
