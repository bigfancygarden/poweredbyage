Our 76th Zoomcast (October 14, 2021);

Host Charlotte Sista C Ferrell introduces Peter Jailall, our featured guest, who is a retired teacher continuing his work as an activist through storytelling and poetry performances across Canada and the Caribbean. He evokes comments about the influence of grandparents after tenderly reading his poems Aja and Aji, dedicated to his paternal grandfather and grandmother. Listening to his poems Gratitude, When September Comes, and Black Skin generate discussion of systemic racism and sexism.

Members of our live “Zoomcast” discuss the benefits of creative arts and meditation in the classroom as demonstrated by hearing Peter read his anti-bullying book for children, Stop! Stop! Don’t Be a Bully! which is available for purchase through Amazon.ca.

Charlotte concludes with possible topics for future PBA podcast meetings and welcomes ideas. Listeners can send suggestions to pbaafc@gmail.com

Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society; The Government of Canada: New Horizons Program; and G & F Financial.
