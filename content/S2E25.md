In our 25th Zoomcast (October 13, 2020) - a recording of a live broadcast for 2 Anniversaries: First, the 30th anniversary of the UN International Year of the Older Person with special guests; and then to recognize the Powered by Age Podcast Program’s FIRST Anniversary as a Senior-led podcast creation sponsored by the 411 Center and the City of Vancouver, we’ll hear some ways creating podcasts have affected  participants’ lives.

As  this party rolls on, we’ll be “rolling out” our brand new Website and  “Listening Sessions” with our seniors’ savvy Stories, Poems, Interviews  and News. If you haven’t already, now is a perfect time to join this  inspiring, friendship-building group.  You'll learn more about “remote  communications” and creative ways to express your ideas and issues.

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
