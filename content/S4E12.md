Our host #CharlotteSistaCFerrell announces the launch of her video poem Choose to Challenge.

Neall Ryon reads an article an extract from Letters from an American by Heather Cox Richardson about the chaotic history of Juneteenth. Read at heathercoxrichardson.substack.com

Lesley Hebert reads the poem Bed in Summer by RL Stevenson and we share our summer memories and talk about the impact of summer on our creativity.

Charlotte reads her poem Can you Imagine?

Neall shares his plan to create a book by travelling to various communities across the province and gathering creative writing from seniors. Anyone interested in taking part or sponsoring Neall’s project can contact him at ncr223@gmail.com

Listeners hear different versions of the song Summertime.

In closing, Charlotte reminds us that the nature or our podcast is to “speak up listen up act upon”  – to share ideas and work for change – and encourages listeners to contact her at pbaafc@gmail.com to have their work recorded for the easy listening section of the PBA website.
