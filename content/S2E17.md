For our 17th Zoomcast (August 6, 2020), we celebrated PRIDE!

In our pre-segment, Marion Pollack from the 411 Seniors Centre Society provides a quick update on OAS/GIS payments and the volunteer income tax filing program.

In the first segment, Chris Morrissey talks a bit about the history of Pride since the 1960’s and what has changed in the LGBTQ community.

In the second segment, Cyndia Cole reads a poem “PRIDE: What Pride Means to Me”.

In the third segment, Farren Gillaspie reads a fictional memoir.

In the fourth segment, Janie reads a short story about coming out and her first labrys.

In our final segment, the group shares and discusses various stories about their LGBTQ-related experiences.

Special thanks to Robin Eriksson and Chris Morrissey for all their hard work planning and coordinating this week’s episode.

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
