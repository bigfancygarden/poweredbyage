In our 20th Zoomcast (August 27, 2020), our special guest hosts a creative writing workshop.

Today teacher and published poet Cynthia Sharpe facilitates a unique experiential workshop to foster inspiration and creativity.

Cynthia opens with a reading and discussion of her poem Alone and Together which centres around gratitude and a focus on the present moment. Participants prepare for the writing segment by moving and stretching before producing sensory descriptions of meaningful objects they have brought to the session. Everyone shares what they have written and Cynthia closes with a reading of her poem Remembering.

Hosted by Charlotte “Sista C” Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
