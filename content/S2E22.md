Two 411 Seniors’ Centre board members. Patsy Craig outlines  technological challenges faced by seniors, and David Handelman talks  about efforts to provide free computers to low income seniors.

Bella Coola Elder Mary Mack describes difficulties faced by seniors  in remote communities and overcomes some of the challenges of  long-distance virtual communications.
