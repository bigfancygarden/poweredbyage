Our 35th Zoomcast (December 10, 2020);

Charlotte Ferrell hosts a discussion on “what can you do” in recognition of the UN International Human Rights Day theme, “Recover Better”. Judith Rainey shares intentions expressed by Eleanor Rosevelt on the power of individual small action.

Participants discuss the increased inequality created by COVID 19, the need to speak up against systemic racism and to work towards change, even in small ways, and the importance of storytelling as a means to raise awareness.

Neall Ryon shares his recent interaction with a telephone scammer which made him aware of the importance of forgiveness.

411 Seniors Centre Board member David Handelman reports that, as a result of sustained, collective effort by the 411 and other senior centers, Telus has introduced an internet phone service for low income seniors.
