Our 37th Zoomcast (12/24/2020);

Charlotte 'Sista C' Ferrell hosts our Christmas Eve podcast session featuring a Christmas sing along with Ukulele music by Instructor/Performer Jane Belanger and song leader/Zentangle instructor, Judy Heintz.

They led us in favorites like We Wish you a Merry Christmas, Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman and Feliz Navidad. Good-hearted conversation carried this activity to hearing one of our podcast developers, Joel Flynn, treat us to a beautiful Karaoke cover of Dean Martinâ€™s Silver Bells.

Charlotte read a new poem, 'Happiness is Having Our Friendship', and dedicated it to our podcast family. We discussed ways that music and sing along help release the kind of healing brain chemicals we all need right now.

We sent sincere wishes of health, wholeness and happiness to all who contribute to or listen to this podcast.
