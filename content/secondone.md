Second attempt! I trashed the Obsidian Publish site, and went over to Quartz. It was a bit more futzing (had a hell of a time with some quirky GitHub settings) but in the end, pretty smooth, and it works and looks great also.

I moved away from GitHub pages, and instead used Cloudflare, which is where I have the domain registered (pretty cheap, would recommend). So far so good.

I was running into a bit of a problem where I didn't format the frontmatter correctly (I forgot to add the 3 dashes). It was causing my GitHub upload to fail. But now it appears to be working.

I'm playing around with Quartz's features. For example, I just added the date to this post in the frontmatter. I should see what other frontmatter fields exist.

It's talking about Analytics services (alternatives to Google). So far, I see Plausible, Umami, GoatCounter and Posthog.

I think I'm going to change the font. I changed the font. I made it Roboto, but didn't like it as much, so went back to the old one, Source Sans Pro.

^ I was trying to put in a Callout but it doesn't appear to be working. Okay now it's working. I was typing it incorrectly. I enabled something in settings. I'm going to turn it off to see if it mattered or not.

Okay, so I had enabled something " enableInHtmlEmbed: " but then disabled it as it wasn't the problem with my callouts. Well they're working now. Great.
