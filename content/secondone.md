Second attempt! I trashed the Obsidian Publish site, and went over to Quartz. It was a bit more futzing (had a hell of a time with some quirky GitHub settings) but in the end, pretty smooth, and it works and looks great also.

I moved away from GitHub pages, and instead used Cloudflare, which is where I have the domain registered (pretty cheap, would recommend). So far so good. Thanks.
