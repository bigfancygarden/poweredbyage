Our first Zoomcast (April 16, 2020) replaces in-person podcasting from the 411 Seniorsâ€™ Centre.

Following brainstorming for upcoming shows and a discussion of technical issues connected with Zoom, we discuss two questions posed by the Planning Department of the City of Vancouver:

What would it take for you to feel safe in Vancouver?

What things would you like to see that would reflect more culture and art?

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
