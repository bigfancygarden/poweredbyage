Our 85th Zoomcast (December 16, 2021);

Host Charlotte Sista C Ferrell introduces our featured  presenter, Johnnie Proby, a jazz and gospel recording artist, and ‘Sound  Healing Practitioner. She sings Nat King Cole’s The Christmas Song,  which generates a discussion about the powerful ways music and other  vocal practices stimulate healing vibrations that regulate stress and  act as a memory trigger for people with memory loss. Our virtual  participants introduce themselves with the name of their favorite song.  Johnnie explains how the words, tone or pace of our favorite songs help  create our Heart song. Dr. Ramona Srinivasen chants the Lotus Sutra and  explains it relaxing effect. Nansey Sinclaire shares how calming her  heart while walking dogs and encountering a bear has lead to the bear  walking past without bothering them.

Neall Ryon shares his poem The Yellow Umbrella which  includes the song Sing a Song of Sunshine. You can enjoy more of Neall’s poems at fromtheotherside.ca
