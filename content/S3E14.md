Our 64th Zoomcast (July 22, 2021);

We discuss the importance of reviewing and following the Covid-19 regulations the 411 Senior Center and other senior centers are communicating to members as they slowly resume services. Charlotte presents some colorful infographics on ways exercise benefits muscles, circulation, and brain health. She leads an “virtual outdoor movement” activity where everyone first imagines themselves like a small animal and mimics its movement, then we go a guided visioning activity moving as tree branches. We concluded there is a benefit to breaking up our hour-long weekly meeting with exercises and will invite practitioners of different modalities, such as Emotional Freedom Technique.
