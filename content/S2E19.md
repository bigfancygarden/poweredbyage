For our 19th Zoomcast (August 20, 2020), we discuss walkable cities: What are the benefits of walking, what makes a city walkable, and how can we make cities more walkable?

We also welcome to the show Alix Tier from BEST (Better Environmentally Sound Transportation), who discusses some of the initiatives their organization is working on.

Special thanks to Neall Ryon for organizing and chairing this week's episode, and for sharing his poem “Just a Step Away”.

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
