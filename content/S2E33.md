Our 33rd Zoomcast (November 26, 2020);

Host Robin Erickson introduces us to Judy Lynne, an instructor and Zentangle practitioner who enthusiastically discusses and demonstrates this inter-related, meditative creative art form. Listeners may wish to look up Zentangle videos on the internet.

Robin facilitates a lively word association game where participants build stories from random and related words. Many people expressed joy in doing this activity that had many variations at home parties in the past.

Charlotte asks for suggestions on the number of songs for our Dec. 24, 1 pm Christmas Eve Zoom party.

Hosted by Robin Erickson. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver
