Our 63rd Zoomcast (July 15, 2021);

Charlotte facilitated our discussion of favorite authors, writing styles and the challenges or schemes some independent writers face, especially older ones. Neall describes how loving his work provides the motivation to enter contests such as the Writers’ Weekly periodic 24- hour short story contest. Chris and Lesley are making progress in organizing segments they have written for memoires. Lesley shared the benefits of joining a readers’ group where everyone reads segments of their work and gets feedback. Dr. Ramona, a retired professor likes writing children stories, vignettes and exploring “influencers.” Charlotte shared her positive experience in getting her book, Heart Balm Just for You accepted into the Vancouver Public Library system.
