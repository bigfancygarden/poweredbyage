Our 11th Zoomcast (June 25, 2020) welcomes two very special guests.

In the first segment, Vancouver City Councillor and anti-poverty activist Jean Swanson focuses on housing, poverty and homelessness among seniors, and looks at potential solutions for the housing crisis in the Lower Mainland.

In the second segment, Marcy Cohen discusses health care support, promotion and prevention for both seniors who wish to “age in place” and for those in care settings.

Morgan Jacko and Kendra Crowell talk about the challenges of helping seniors access communication technology

Hosted by Charlotte "Sista C" Ferrell. Sponsored by the 411 Seniors Centre Society and the City of Vancouver.
